Stack Exchange 2 Drupal migration
=================================

This module will take data from a set of stack exchange dump files and create a Drupal site with that data. The goal is *NOT* to create a fully functional site which can be put online to rival stack exchange. There are two purpouses for this module
 * To act as an example for the migrate module, helping others to learn.
 * (Potentially) to alow people to test their infrastructure at scale with realistic data. As an alternative to devel generate.

The stack exchange people were nice enough to provide this data under a CC licence, and I am re distributing under that licence.
